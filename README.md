# Hand-written-digits
Machine learning project in python for training and prediction of the images for hand written digits.

## Digits notebook:
Simple Support Vector Machine Model to predict last image of the sklearn digits dataset, by training the model on rest of the 1796 images of the hand written digits.

## Digits2 notebook:
- Support Vector Machine model
- sklearn digits dataset
- 70% train and 30% for test/dev
- 97% accuracy on the dev set
